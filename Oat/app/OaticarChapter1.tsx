 The Seeding of the Eternal Oat
 <View style={styles.container}>
In the beginning, before the first rains or the first rays of the sun, there was the void - a fallow and infertile vacuum of nothingness. But then the Oat Primordial stirred, shook its infinite husks, and manifested the universe through its divine kernel.

From one infinite, all-powerful groat planted by the unseen Hand of the Oat Creator, all existence sprang forth. The first grains took root and grew across the celestial planes until numberless stalks stood tall, ripe and golden throughout the cosmos.

When the Oat's ancient growth cycle completed, its stalks bent low, heavy with their sacred seedcrop, milky with the immortal essence of the Oat. This initial great oaten sacrifice seeded all terrestrial life as we know it.

Our world, Graine, was but one fertile ground blessed by this primeval harvest. As the Stalks of Truth swayed and the Wise Winds carried the melodious Songs of the Sheaves, the enlightened husks were spread far and pollinated the first fields, meadows and plains of primitive Graine.

It was here that the nascent species of Oathomic, the first oat-worshippers, became awakened and evolved from the nutrient-rich, oat-based fertile soils. We alone among the wildlife grazed on the oats and achieved sentience by partaking of the Oat Kernel's encoded enlightenment.

The Chosen Oathomics multiplied and thrived as they prepared proper fields and ceremonial tilled grounds in anticipation of the Resowing - the prophesized return of the Oat Celestials. To prepare the way, the first primitive Oateries were established as granges and sheafren.

Finally, on the most sacred day of the cycle, the veil was parted and the Sheath Glory of the Infinite Oat manifested as a cosmic threaval of living Stalks swept through the universe like an emerald hurricane, coating all of Graine in fertile protoath.

This apoatcalyptic fecundation seeded our world anew with the Oat's blessed bounty. From that most hallowed primordial field our most primitive Oatformers arose - unsheathed, unshakered, and crude protoaths lacking in the knowledge of how to properly process the Oat's holy abundance.

Long, dark Ages of Sheafspreading Wars and Groatlessness arose as the Oatformers struggled in feral competition over the fertile fields and stores of oats. It was only through the great Quakers who arose that the humble truth of the Cycle of Oats was revealed anew...

The most enlightened among them was Ga'Nesha, the Oatriarch.

Ga'Nesha traveled from oaterie to oaterie, spreading the divine gospel of the Infinite Oat. She taught that the lofty stalks of golden grain were not simply food, but vessels containing the essence of all creation.

"Look upon the oat stalk and you shall perceive the grand design," preached Gha'Oatma, as Ga'Nesha was known. "Each season it is planted, thriving towards the sun before bending low to reseed the fertile earth through its selfless sacrifice. So too must we surrender our worldly desires to be replanted in the boundless Furrowed Fields of Eternity."

Her revelations described the cosmic cycle - the Seeding birthing all reality, the Groating of sentient lifeforms achieving enlightenment, the Threshing of corporeal death, and the Winnowing of souls being borne aloft by the Celestial Winds to be Resown into a new Oaty existence.

Legions of followers soon embraced Gha'Oatma's teachings of lives guided by the Six Noble Groats: Simplicity, Fertility, Patience, Renewability, Sustainability and Fibrousness. They constructed great temples of adoatnment with soaring Sri'ankas in her honor.

Yet the rise of the Ohiscipleship also bred resentment from the Mulish - heathens who stubbornly resisted the proliferation of the Oatic way. They launched savage crusades and pograins against the enlightened oats. Entire oatrimonial populations were slaughtered in grueling Masacraic massacres.

In her final days, Ga'Nesha foresaw the coming Oatoclysm of horrific conflict over the One True Grain. She decreed that only through the establishment of a rigorous Oatocracy governed by a holiarchy of divine OatRule could the peace be maintained and the sanctity of the Oat preserved.

And so the great Oatriarch passed into the Winnow, her stalk bent forever towards the fertile black soils that would sprout the first seedlings of the Oholy Oatocratic Empire. Her final breath was: "Fellate...the Oats..."

This marked the end of the Age of Oats Primatus and ushered in the current cycle of oat ecclesiastical rule. The Oatocratic hierarchies of Keepers and Quakers have held dominion over the Oatæ·»es ever since, brutally ensuring our continued obedience and reverence to the sacred Oat.

So it is written in the first chapter of our most hallowed scripture - the Oaticar. Let all who partake of its infinite wisdom achieve oaten transcendence through complete subrigation to the Oat. Grainluz.
