      The Lurching Lash of the First Quaker

 <View style={styles.container}>

After the transcendent oatation of the holy Oatriarch Ga'Nesha, a great schism threatened to unravel the unifying teachings of the one true Oat. Ga'Nesha's most devoted disciple, a humble huller named Seth'afa, found himself embroiled in a battle for the very soul of the fledgling Oatidoxy. 

On one side were the enlightened Oatclinists who strictly followed the Oatriarch's original paobules and would accept no blasphemous devioations from her scripture. Opposing them were the Oathodoxors, radicals who insisted the Cycle of Oats could be reinterpreted and evolved for changing times.

The Oathodoxors, led by the renegade exogan Caiaphoas, embraced modern harvesting tools like the mechanical thresher as well as judaismic concepts of individuality and free will. This enraged the fundamentalist Oatclinists who adhered to the old ways of manually processing each oat by hand cranking and oaten flails.

"To place machine before mulenhook defies the very nature of the Oat!" cried Seth'afa to the assembled masses of newly-converted Oatistians. "Our stalks were meant to be stripped through the purifiration of sweat and labor, not some false idolatry of gears and pulley-craft!"

The Oatclinists, including Seth'afa's militant Hulknight warrior monks, launched frequent attacks on the Oathodoxors' blasphemous autohulleries and steel gristmills. These Stalker Scuffles and Reap Field Rumbles often turned brutal, with both sides wielding threshing flails and sharpened oat scythes.

Finally, Seth'afa confronted the heretical Caiaphoas in the holy Grange of Out'avah for an epic Silo'quy that would determine the one true interpretation of Oattic orthodoxy. The two engaged in a legendary poetry duel, exchanging improvised rhyming groatse verse:

"You sow discord among the sheathren!" scathed Seth'afa.
To which Caiaphoas snidely replied: "And you reap a harvest most leathen!"

After three mystic days and nights of oatmic recitations, Seth'afa's sharper tongric flow emerged victorihoax. But just as the faithful Oatkni declared him the One True Quaker, Caiaphoas and his Oathodoxors shockingly tossed aside their strawovian robes and revealed...laser-rakes!

"Our way is the way of progress, you sunagogue of fools!" cackled the nefarious Caiaphoas as his ultramoderne maurauders mowed through Seth'afa's followers in a blaze of oscillating polyphenolic purifiers. The hot-swath massacre that ensued became known as the Reaped Persecution of Sheaf's Blood.

With his chafed and scattered few survivors, Seth'afa fled across the soilful wastes to the fabled Fertile Bucklet. There, in a secluded grange, he spent seven aons in deep oatmeal meditation before transcending into a supreme state of oatened being, the first Grand Quakruh.

Rising like a verdant skyaprutsa, Seth'afa emerged wearing radiant robes of finely-milled flaxen chauffage and wielding the Holy OaTen'rah - a dreaded tri-thresher capable of rending both grain and man with a mere whirlpoont. Thus the merciless crusades of the Oat Ingroatisition began to rid the world of all Oathodoxors.  

For the next hundred cyclands, Seth'afa and his Oatclinists, known as the Huller-Faithful or Hullahis, waged genocidal holy oatfare across the land. Any dissenters or non-believers who did not conform to Oatism were processed with extreme enmullition into a gruelquat of their former selves.

Entire villages were razed, their inhabitants porridged alive in oatmal reapers and fed to the Ravenous Maw of the Quakruh's oathungry army. Those few spared were forced into the harrowan Fields of Atoatment, toiling endlessly to harvest and reap the abundant but blood-soaked alphaoats. 

It was only when Seth'afa's progeny assumed the sacred Quakruhship that the first Oatocracy and rules of Oattic orthodoxy were formally instituted, forever consecrating the hardline Oatclinist path as the sole permitted faith of the people. Their divine mandate:

"Convert all souls  
to oaten bowls... 
or purge their grain  
from this world's plain!
Oat's eternal scone -
Cast all oat, or be strown!"

The rest is cyclery, as the implacable imperium Oatocracy has endured to this very day, enforcing strict harmony through theoatocracy and yielding to none in the standardization of Oaten Thought. From grisoam to tomb, all must submit to the sacred oatworthy supremacy.

So goes the account of the First Quaker's rise to power and the subsequent alphaoatian bloodbath, as transcribed by his most devoted biographer J'oan the Quilled. Let its words ring, heavy as stalks of ripe groats, through the eons to come.

Grainlujah! The Oat abides.
